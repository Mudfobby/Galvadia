Galvadia is a single player open world MUD-style RPG. This was originally a project that I started to put lessons I was learning to use through practice. I started off making simple objects, arrays, functions, and eventually utilizing DOM manipulation to create an
interactive experience.

DISCLAIMER: Much of this code was written having very little coding experience. I've since learned how to structure and organize code through file structuring conventions, modularizing code, and SOC. This project is more to display creative ideas and solutions put
into practice rather than technical coding skills, though there are a variety of coding techniques I used to enable functionality.
