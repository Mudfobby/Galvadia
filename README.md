This project is something I started to teach myself how to code while also doing something creative. I understand that it's very messy, and not how loads of code should be crammed into a single file like a loaf of bread into a toaster.

Galvadia is a fantasy based MUD (or SUD) open world RPG. The main feature of the game is the combat, but there are also quests, shops, npcs, and areas to explore. The world is small at the moment with only a few combat areas. I almost have all the groundwork laid to start building out the world, so I will be adding much more soon.

- This is not set up for playthrough yet. Everything is set up for testing, but you can still play through the start, and get far enough to explore a bit, interact with npcs, shops, quests, and fight in combat areas.
- There is no official "start" to the game yet. Choose your class and race by clicking on the buttons, then scroll down til you see the welcome are room description, then follow that!
- Does not include game instructions yet. Hopefully the in-game tutorial is enough to learn the basics.
- The game can break. This is still very much a work in progress, and some bugs might be in the game that prevent you from continuing on, though I've done my best to clear those bugs out.
- There is no way to save your game progress yet.
- I have only worked on this in Chrome and with my computer settings/resolution, so I have no idea how this would run in other browsers.
