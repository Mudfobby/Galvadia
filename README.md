DISCLAIMER
Galvadia started off as a tool for teaching myself how to code, before I created my first object. The code itself is not what I would call maintainable by any standard, and does not represent how I would program and structure my code today. The codebase contains a mix of code that I've written from day 1 til now, so there's a wide range of inefficient to somewhat more efficient code scattered throughout. 

The game is very much in development, and there are potentially game breaking bugs that I might not have discovered yet. Once I iron out a stable early-game playthrough, I will be working to balance mechanics like weapon damage, armor effectiveness, skill and ability scaling, etc. Those mechanics exist and are already somewhat stable, but there might be some inconsistencies or over/under powered aspects that I haven't tuned up/down yet. The game start is not set up how I would like it to be for a clean experience as doing so would make it more difficult to quickly reload the game to test things out.

All that being said, it does have playable and in-depth content, particularly the leveling and combat. Only recently did I get most of the groundwork laid for scaling the game larger, so once I get the tutorial complete with an instruction manual to include in the files, I'll be building the game out and making it more stable. (SOON!)
