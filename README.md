DISCLAIMER
Galvadia started off as a tool for teaching myself how to code, before I created my first object. The code itself is not what I would call maintainable by any standard, and does not represent how I would program and structure my code today. The codebase contains a mix of code that I've written from day 1 til now, so there's a wide range of inefficient to somewhat more efficient code scattered throughout. 

The game is very much in development, and there are potentially game breaking bugs that I might not have discovered yet. Once I iron out a stable early-game playthrough, I will be working to balance mechanics like weapon damage, armor effectiveness, skill and ability scaling, etc. Those mechanics exist and are already somewhat stable, but there might be some inconsistencies or over/under powered aspects that I haven't tuned up/down yet. The game start is not set up how I would like it to be for a clean experience as doing so would make it more difficult to quickly reload the game to test things out.

All that being said, it does have playable and in-depth content, particularly the leveling and combat. Only recently did I get most of the groundwork laid for scaling the game larger, so once I get the tutorial complete with an instruction manual to include in the files, I'll be building the game out and making it more stable. (SOON!)


ABOUT
Galvadia is an immersive, text-based RPG where players journey through the story, while engaging in dialogue and fighting their way through enemies. Drawing inspiration from classic MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) games, it offers deep character customization and strategic and skill based combat.

KEY FEATURES
- Players can choose from 13 classes (each unique in their playstyle)
- Players can choose from 11 races
- A variety of rewarding quests
- Weapon, armor, and item shops
- Interactive NPCs (quests and dialogue)
- Item enhancement system
- Skill and ability progression by gaining and spending Skill Points
- Immersive combat

** Mystic Monk and Elemental Monk need to be reworked/adjusted. I don't think they have any game breaking bugs, just maybe some scaling issues and wonky ability mechanics (mainly the Elemental Monk). Feel free to choose them though if you want to test them out **
